Sharma is admitted in the medicine ward of the Delhi government-run hospital, where he is being treated for high fever and nausea. \"He\n\nwas running high grade temperature and complained of nausea when he was brought to us yesterday (on Tuesday). We are conducting tests to determine the cause of fever,\" said a senior doctor at the hospital, requesting anonymity as the doctor is not authorised to speak to media.\n\n\"We have put him on strong medication and he is being monitored closely,\" the doctor added. Sharma was brought to the hospital's casualty on Tuesday around 5pm, after being referred there from another Delhi government-run Hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhayay (DDU).\n\nHe was brought to DDU emergency on May 8 from the Tihar Jail clinic where he was taken after fellow inmates allegedly assaulted him.\n\nTihar Jail authorities have vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nAt DDU, he was admitted into the high-security ward number 10, in the department of medicine, where all patients under heavy security are admitted.\n\nHowever, doctors at DDU claimed there was nothing serious with him and he was referred to Lok Nayak only for some tests.\n\n\"He had very high fever which was not coming down; he needed certain tests to determine the exact cause of fever that were not available in DDU at the moment, which is why we had to refer him to Lok Nayak Hospital. All his routine investigations, such as blood tests and ultrasound were normal,\" said a doctor at the hospital.",
