	"text": "VLC, the media player that enables users to watch nearly every video format on iOS devices, is back after a two-year hiatus.\n\nA spin-off of the popular desktop version, VideoLAN's VLC was pulled from the App Store due to open source licensing issues a few months after launch in October 2010.\n\nThe licensing problems have been settled now, and the app is currently being rolled out for both the iPhone and the iPad.\n\nA couple of new features are on the table as well, including AirPlay support, network streaming, background audio playback, subtitles support, video filters and Dropbox integration.",
