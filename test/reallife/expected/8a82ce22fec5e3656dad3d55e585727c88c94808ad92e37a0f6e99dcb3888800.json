	"text": "A coalition of technology companies and civil liberties groups on Thursday will call on President Obama and congressional leaders to dramatically expand the amount of information reported publicly about U.S. government surveillance efforts.\n\nThe request, to be made in a letter with more than 50 signatories, is the most sweeping and cohesive push to bring more accountability to electronic government eavesdropping in the aftermath of revelations about the National Security Agency’s collection of user data.\n\nThe letter will call on the government to remove restrictions that keep companies from reporting the number of surveillance requests they receive from U.S. officials citing national security grounds. Several companies already produce regular “transparency reports” listing information when the requests relate to criminal investigations.\n\nThe expected signatories, including Microsoft, Google and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, also will call on the government to issue its own regular reports offering an overall account of the information it is gathering from telecommunication and technology companies, which have been stung by portrayals of their cooperation with NSA data requests.\n\n“This information about how and how often the government is using these legal authorities is important to the American people, who are entitled to have an informed public debate about the appropriateness of those authorities and their use, and to the international users of U.S.-based service providers who are concerned about the privacy and security of their communications,” said the draft version of the letter, which was obtained by The Washington Post. It is due for public release Thursday morning.\n\nThe Center for Democracy & Technology, a Washington-based nonprofit group, organized the letter, which attracted a wide range of support, including trade groups, press freedom groups and more than 20 companies.\n\nThe composition of the coalition — including tech firms and privacy groups that sometimes criticize them — underscores the broad concern generated by revelations about NSA surveillance programs.\n\n“The American people lack basic information about the scope of the government’s surveillance of the Internet, information that many companies would eagerly share with their users if only they weren’t gagged by the government,” said Kevin S. Bankston, senior counsel for the Center for Democracy & Technology. “All we’re asking for in this letter is the same type of general numerical information that has been published about law enforcement surveillance for years.”\n\nThe public push comes amid rising concern on Capitol Hill about the secretive collection of phone and Internet data, especially when it involves U.S. citizens.\n\nHouse members expressed serious concern about NSA programs in a hearing Wednesday. Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) sent a letter Tuesday asking Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. to give companies more latitude to publicly disclose the number of surveillance requests."
