	"text": "Facebook‘s  international, mobile shopping spree continues.\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced that it has agreed to acquire Monoidics, a U.K. company that sells software that checks other software for coding errors. Facebook, which is picking up Monoidics’ technology and some members of its engineering team, said it will be applying the software to its mobile development process.\n\n“This asset acquisition represents our investment in the quality of our mobile applications platform and also our people, as members of their talented engineering team will join us to work at Facebook’s London office once the deal closes,” said Philip Su, a director of Facebook London’s engineering team, in a post on his Facebook profile.\n\nFacebook has been pretty transparent about its ambitions in M&A: The bulk of its deals over the past year have targeted mobile software and mobile engineers.\n\nAt a recent technology conference, Dan Rose, the company’s vice president of partnerships, said the company will do more mobile product acquisitions, as it transitions to a “mobile best” company.\n\nIn April, Facebook purchased mobile startup Parse in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $85 million, people with knowledge of the matter have said. Earlier this year, it also considered buying Waze, a mapping service that was ultimately snapped up by Google for $1.1 billion.",
