The Presidential Memorandum calls for the creation of the aptly named Project Open Data, with the goal of making government data \"available, discoverable, and usable – in a word, open\".\n\nToday's news marks the first time a government entity has published law as a living, collaborative document. We're excited to see how the Open Data Policy evolves with the input of the community, and we hope this is just the first of many.\n\nBy choosing GitHub Pages, government employees as well as citizens are empowered to continuously propose and discuss potential improvements, creating a living policy document to \"unlock the potential of government data\".\n\nCivic hackers and public servants at all levels are using GitHub to collaborate on everything from information about elected officials to the location of the nearest bike rack. While adding a to a pull request isn't going to replace ballots at your local polling place any time soon, one thing's for sure: the revolution is only just beginning.",
