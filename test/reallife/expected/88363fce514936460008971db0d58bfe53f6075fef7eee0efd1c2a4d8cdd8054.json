	"text": "Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has been freed from jail pending an appeal, a day after being sentenced to five years for embezzlement.\n\nThe court ruled that keeping him in custody would deprive him of his right to stand in the mayoral elections in Moscow in September.\n\nThousands of Russians had protested against his conviction, saying it was politically motivated.\n\nNavalny is a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe elections in Moscow are on 8 September and - for now at least - he is being allowed to campaign, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford.\n\nTravel restrictions\n\nOn Thursday, Navalny was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled timber worth 16m roubles ($500,000; Â£330,000) from the Kirovles state timber company while working as an adviser to Kirov's governor Nikita Belykh.\n\nAt the end of a three-hour verdict reading, he was sentenced to five years in jail.\n\nBut on Friday, the Kirov regional court took just over an hour to hear the bail case and make its decision.\n\nThe three judges decided that, as Navalny had not breached his bail conditions during the trial, he should allowed to await the appeal decision at home in Moscow.\n\nNavalny and his co-accused Pyotr Ofitserov were immediately released, and Navalny embraced his wife Yulia.\n\n\"I am very grateful to all the people who supported us, all the people who went to [protest on Moscow's] Manezh Square and other squares,\" he said.\n\nIt was not just the defence pleading Navalny's case. In an unexpected move, prosecutors also pushed for him to remain free, with travel restrictions, pending his appeal.\n\nAnalysts said this could be an attempt by officials to soothe public anger over the case.\n\nAfter the verdict on Thursday there were violent scuffles, as thousands of people took to the streets in Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities in protests that continued late into the evening. Reports said dozens were detained by police.\n\nOther countries questioned the fairness of the verdict, with the EU saying it posed \"serious questions\" about the rule of law in Russia, while the US said it was \"deeply disappointed\".\n\nA spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the trial had \"raised doubts about whether criminal justice was the main motive\".\n\nThe Kremlin denies that Mr Putin uses courts for political ends, and the judge rejected Navalny's claim that the trial was politically motivated.\n\nNavalny, 37, is a leading campaigner against President Putin's United Russia party and has regularly blogged about corruption allegations.\n\nHe came to public attention when he inspired mass protests against the Kremlin and President Putin in December 2011.\n\nBefore he was led away to jail on Thursday, Navalny urged his supporters to continue his anti-corruption struggle, tweeting: \"Don't sit around doing nothing.\"",
