	"text": "Today’s Big Winner: Indiana Pacers\n\nThe Knicks are done.\n\nThere is a lot to argue about in sports — did Andrew Wiggins make the right choice in picking Kansas, what are the Dodgers doing letting Clayton Kershaw throw 132 pitches, is Kawhi Leonard really the best player on the Spurs — but can we all agree the Knicks are done?\n\nEven with a theoretical two games left in NYC, the notion of New York — the way they looked last night — winning three straight against these Pacers is beyond credulity.\n\nJR Smith threw himself under the bus: “I take the blame for this whole series.”\n\nIt’s easy to look at Smith’s 7-of-22 clunkery and saddle him with responsibility for last night’s loss, but of any Knicks player who logged more than 15 minutes last night, Smith was the only one with a positive plus-minus rating.\n\nNo, there is enough blame to go around: The Knicks got out-rebounded (out-hustled 54-36). They have no bench (besides Smith, who clearly feels the need to try to do too much by himself). Mike Woodson couldn’t make adjustments. And, oh by the way, the Pacers played brilliantly.\n\nThe story of these NBA Playoffs has gone from the individual performances of superstars like Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant or Carmelo Anthony to the largely anonymous team-first grinding of the Pacers, Grizzlies and Spurs. (As always, LeBron is exceptional.)\n\nSay what you want about building around superstars (Indiana’s Paul George certainly qualifies as a neo-star at this point), but the Pacers have illuminated a workmanlike new path to success in the postseason — and stark contrast — to the blueprint of the glitzy Knicks.\n\nMaybe the Knicks should think about that when they start assessing blame for the early summer this year.",
