	"text": "MIAMI – The San Antonio Spurs returned to the NBA Finals just the way they left — with a victory over LeBron James.\n\nTim Duncan overcame a slow start to finish with 20 points and 14 rebounds, Tony Parker banked in a desperation jumper on a broken play with 5.2 seconds left and the Spurs withstood James’ triple-double to beat the Miami Heat 92-88 on Thursday night in a thrilling Game 1.\n\nParker ended up with 21 points after referees reviewed his shot to make sure it just beat the shot clock, giving San Antonio a four-point edge in a game that was close the whole way.\n\n“Tony’s shot is one of those things that happens sometimes,” the Spurs’ Manu Ginobili said. “We got lucky today.”\n\nJames had 18 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists in his second straight NBA Finals triple-double, but he shot only 7-for-16 against some good defense by Kawhi Leonard, and Miami’s offense stalled in the fourth quarter.\n\nPlaying for the championship for the first time since sweeping James’ Cleveland Cavaliers in 2007, the Spurs improved to 5-for-5 in Game 1s, hanging around for three quarters and then blowing by the defending champions midway through the fourth.\n\nGinobili, the third member of San Antonio’s Big Three that has combined for 99 postseason victories together, finished with 13 points, and Danny Green had 12.\n\n“It doesn’t matter how we’re categorized — old, veterans, whatever you call us, we’re in the mix,” Duncan said.\n\nGame 2 is Sunday night.\n\nJames became a champion on this floor last year in Game 5 against Oklahoma City, but he hasn’t forgotten his first taste of the finals.\n\nThe Spurs overwhelmed his Cavaliers and James spoke Wednesday like someone who had payback in mind. He was 22 then, a fourth-year player headed for greatness but with holes in his game that San Antonio exploited.\n\nRevenge won’t come easily — if it comes at all.\n\nDwyane Wade scored 17 points for the Heat but was shut out in the fourth quarter. Chris Bosh had only two of his 13 in the final period.\n\nJames shot an airball on a three-pointer on his first shot attempt, then was soon back to the step-in-front-of-him-at-your-own-risk force that has made him the game’s best player.\n\nBut San Antonio handled that and everything else Miami did, even while only shooting 42 percent from the field.\n\nForced to seven grueling games by the rugged Indiana Pacers in the East finals, the Heat clearly enjoyed the more wide-open flow of this game, making 18 of their first 30 shots. But the Spurs’ defense got better as the game went along, and San Antonio held the Heat to seven points in the first 8 ½ minutes of the final quarter.\n\n“I thought we were a little fatigued honestly in the fourth quarter,” Wade said. “Looking around, we looked like a team that came off a seven-game series.”",
