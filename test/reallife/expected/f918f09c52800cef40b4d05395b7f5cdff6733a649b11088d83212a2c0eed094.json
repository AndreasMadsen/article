	"text": "The Indianapolis Colts' offseason of discontent continued Thursday with the NFL handing down an eight-game suspension to tight end Weslye Saunders, according to an NFL spokesman. It was his second violation of the league's policy on performance-enhancing substances.\n\nPreviously, second-year wide receiver LaVon Brazill was suspended four games for his second violation of the league's substance abuse policy. Third-year safety Joe Lefeged was arrested on gun-related charges after a traffic stop in Washington, D.C. The case has been continued.\n\nSaunders, 24, of Gary, Ind., joined the Colts last season just five days after being released by Pittsburgh. The Steelers cut him after he had been suspended four games for testing positive for the stimulant drug adderall.\n\nThe blocking tight end appeared in six games for the Colts and caught two passes for 15 yards. Saunders, who is about to enter his third NFL season, spoke of his mistake when he joined the Colts on Oct. 17, 2012.\n\n\"It's something that was unfortunate, probably led to my dismissal in Pittsburgh,\" he said at the time. \"It was a mistake that I made, taking adderall, something obviously a lot of people are objecting about right now. But I don't have anything to say about it right now because my suspension is over. I served my suspension and I'm ready to get back it now.\"\n\nHe said the drug helped him focus when feeling drowsy, and that his younger brother took it.\n\n\"When you hear performance-enhancing drugs, automatically you kind of think of some guy in the corner shooting up whatever into his veins,\" he said. \"It was nothing like that. A one-time thing. I learned from it and am ready to roll now.\"\n\nSaunders can participate in preseason, but considering the severity of his suspension and the fact he's a reserve player, his roster spot is tenuous at best.",
