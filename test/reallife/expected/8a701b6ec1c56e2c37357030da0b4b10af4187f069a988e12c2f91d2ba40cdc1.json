	"text": "Troubled Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Josh Brent is retiring from the NFL.\n\nThe team made the announcement Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"This is the right decision for me, and something that I have given a lot of thought to,\" Brent said in a statement.\n\n\"I am at a point where my main focus is all about getting the priorities in my life in order. Those priorities are more important than football. Doing the right things in life are more important than football. I love the game very much. I love my teammates, but this is the right thing for me to do.\"\n\nBrent was indicted on intoxication manslaughter charges last December after the car he was driving flipped and killed friend and teammate Jerry Brown in Irving, Texas, on Dec. 8.\n\nBrent is free on bond while he awaits his trial. He faces 20 years in prison.\n\nHe had stayed on the Cowboys roster but never played for the team following the accident.\n\nHowever, he has continued to battle substance abuse. After failing multiple drug tests, a violation of his bond, Brent was incarcerated last month. He was released from jail July 7 but ordered to wear a drug detection patch and was prohibited from driving.\n\nThe Cowboys report to training camp in Oxnard, Calif., on Saturday. A league verdict whether to suspend Brent, a seventh-round pick out of Illinois in the 2010 supplemental draft, was expected soon.\n\n\"With his retirement, there is no action for us to take at this point,\" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said.\n\nIn three seasons, the 6-2, 320-pound nose tackle played in 39 games (five starts) and recorded 31 tackles and 1Â½ sacks.",
