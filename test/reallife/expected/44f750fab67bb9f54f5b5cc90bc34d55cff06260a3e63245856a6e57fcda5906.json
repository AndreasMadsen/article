Melanoma diagnoses have risen nearly 2 percent a year since 2000 and are increasing even more among young white women.\n\nSome experts blame inappropriate use of sunscreen, saying that people do not apply enough lotion (a golfball-size dollop) or do not reapply it every two hours as instructed. But there's another major concern: Until recently, many sunscreens with a high sun protection factor, or SPF, were designed primarily to protect people from ultraviolet B rays, the main cause of sunburn. These sunscreens may have enabled users to stay out longer but did not necessarily protect them from ultraviolet A rays. These are associated with aging and skin damage, but some experts believe they may also be implicated in skin cancer.\n\nExperts are urging people to limit their time in the sun, especially at midday, and protect their skin with hats, shirts and cover-ups instead of relying exclusively on sunscreen.\n\n\"Sunscreen is not a magic bullet,\" says Dr. Steven Q. Wang, director of dermatologic surgery and dermatology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Basking Ridge,\n\nN.J., and a spokesman for the Skin Cancer Foundation, which receives funding from sunscreen manufacturers. \"It's just one of the defenses against the harmful effect of UV radiation, and that message gets lost.\"\n\nThis summer, most of the sunscreen on store shelves must conform to new Food and Drug Administration labeling rules that may help remedy consumer misperceptions. Still, concerns remain about ingredients in some sunscreens.\n\nUse of the label \"broad spectrum protection\" now means the sunscreen has been proved to protect against both UVA and UVB rays, although the UVA protection may be comparatively weaker. Any product with an SPF lower than 15 must carry a label warning that it will not protect against skin cancer. Products cannot claim to be waterproof, only water-resistant, and labels must note a time limit of either 40 or 80 minutes before the sunscreen is ineffective. Manufacturers can still sell sunscreens with SPFs that exceed 50, though FDA officials are evaluating whether they should remain on the market, says Reynold Tan, a scientist in the agency's Division of Nonprescription Regulation Development. It's not clear that sunscreens with higher SPFs actually are more effective, and consumers may not apply them as frequently.\n\nAdvocates like Sonya Lunder, a senior analyst for the Environmental Working Group and an author of its report on sunscreen, have criticized the FDA for backing away from some of its own proposals, like putting in place a star system that would give consumers more information about UVA and UVB protection, capping the SPF values allowed on the market at 50, and banning sunscreen sprays, which may not work as well to prevent sunburn.\n\nEurope and Canada have tougher standards, Lunder says. \"In the U.S., you can make a bad sunscreen and just not call it 'broad spectrum,' but still sell it,\" she says. \"In Europe, the pass-fail test is stronger, and it must protect against both UVA and UVB.\""
