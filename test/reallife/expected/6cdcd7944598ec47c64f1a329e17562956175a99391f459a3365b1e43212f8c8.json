	"text": "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A federal judge on Thursday threw out the Pennsylvania governor's lawsuit against the NCAA over sanctions against Penn State related to Jerry Sandusky, calling his argument \"a Hail Mary pass\" that easily warranted dismissal.\n\nU.S. Middle District Judge Yvette Kane's decision puts an early end to the antitrust lawsuit Gov. Tom Corbett filed in January in which he sought to overturn a $60 million fine, a four-year bowl ban, scholarship limits and other penalties.\n\nShe said she could not \"find any factual allegations supporting (Corbett's) allegation of 'concerted action' that might nudge its conspiracy claim into 'plausible' territory.\"\n\nThe NCAA said it was \"exceedingly pleased\" and hoped the ruling would help heal divisions caused by the Sandusky scandal. Corbett's office said it was working on a statement.\n\nKane said that even if the penalties make it harder for Penn State to recruit quality football players, that would not make it an antitrust case.\n\n\"The fact that Penn State will offer fewer scholarships over a period of four years does not plausibly support its allegation that the reduction of scholarships at Penn State will result in a market-wide anticompetitive effect, such that the 'nation's top scholastic football players' would be unable to obtain a scholarship in the nationwide market for Division I football players,\" Kane wrote.\n\nShe said the questions the case raises are important matters of public debate but are not antitrust grounds.\n\n\"In another forum the complaint's appeal to equity and common sense may win the day, but in the antitrust world these arguments fail to advance the ball,\" Kane said.\n\nPenn State, which agreed to the NCAA penalties, was not a party to the case.\n\nKane produced a \"thorough analysis and thoughtful opinion,\" said Donald Remy, the NCAA's chief legal officer.\n\n\"Our hope is that this decision not only will end this case but also serve as a beginning of the end of the divide among those who, like Penn State, want to move forward to put the horror of the Sandusky crimes behind the university and those who want to prolong the fight and with it the pain for all involved,\" Remy said.\n\nDuring arguments last month, the NCAA's lawyer said the sanctions were not likely to harm the overall market for higher education or for top-flight football players. He said antitrust law did not apply and that the organization acted to enforce rules about honesty, sportsmanship and conduct.\n\nSandusky, a former university assistant football coach, is serving a decades-long prison sentence for sexual abuse of 10 boys. He has maintained his innocence."
