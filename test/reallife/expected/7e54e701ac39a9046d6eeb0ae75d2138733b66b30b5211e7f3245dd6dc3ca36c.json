There have been reports of explosions prior to the fire, or an ammonia leak, which may have made the fire worse.\n\nWorkers say that most of the exits to the factory were locked, making it difficult to escape.\n\n\"You had to get the team leader's permission before going to the toilet, and the doors would only be opened then,\" a former worker, who was only identified by his surname, Li, told state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nInvestigators said the fire was a \"serious accident due to negligence\", but stressed that the cause of the disaster could not yet be determined, a microblog post from the Jilin government said.\n\nInitial investigations suggested that the factory's safety management was \"confused\", responsibilities were \"not implemented\" and that safety drills had not been carried out, it added.\n\n\"The provincial government and relevant departments did not fully implement their regulatory responsibilities.\"\n\nSome users on weibo, China's version of Twitter, expressed anger at the news.\n\n\"Why were all these problems not discovered before - where is the supervision?\" user Little Logo Pig wrote.\n\n\"Jilin's safety supervision chief should resign. Where has regular supervision gone?\" user Ivan asked.",
