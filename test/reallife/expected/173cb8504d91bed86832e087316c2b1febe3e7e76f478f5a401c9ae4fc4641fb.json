	"text": "BITTERFELD: Germany pushed on with frantic efforts to secure saturated river dykes with sandbags Thursday, bracing for a surge of the worst floods in over a decade that have claimed 12 lives and forced mass evacuations across central Europe.\n\nVast stretches along the Elbe river basin have turned into a sea of brown water in the Czech Republic and downstream in eastern Germany, with only red-tiled roofs sticking out of the muddy water in many abandoned villages and towns.\n\nThe picture of devastation was similar along the mighty Danube, which has jumped its banks in Germany's southern Bavaria state and Austria and sparked large-scale disaster preparations in Hungary, where the water was expected to peak in coming days.\n\nIn northeast Germany, thousands of volunteers, many organized through social media, firefighters, aid workers and troops have filled millions of sandbags to hold back the torrent, which has risen from two to above eight meters (six to above 26 feet).\n\nThousands worked through the night or kept a nervous watch on flood barriers while recalling dark memories of the 2002 floods that killed scores across central Europe and caused a clean-up bill running to billions of euros (dollars).\n\nFears were centered on Bitterfeld in Saxony-Anhalt state where two lakes, one higher than the other, loom dangerously close to a city that during the communist East Germany era became notorious as a heavily polluted industrial centre.\n\nLocal officials have warned that a breach in the lake defences could spark a \"mini-tsunami\" that could engulf the city, and officials have twice attempted to blowholes in the lake dyke away from the city, with limited success.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel has promised 100 million euros ($130 million) in immediate flood relief across Germany, and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble promised on Thursday that more money would follow.\n\nDresden, with more than two million people, said the peak of 8.75 metres was reached on Thursday, with floodwaters lapping through the mud-caked living\n\nrooms and trashed gardens of thousands of outlying homes.\n\nHowever, flood barriers installed secured the old inner city --dubbed the “Jewel Box” for its baroque and rococo churches, opera and buildings\n\nafter the even higher 2002 flood.\n\nPeople also breathed a cautious sigh of relief as water levels eased in Halle, where Elbe tributary the Saale had reached its highest level in 400 years the day before and authorities have urged 30,000 people to flee.\n\nUpstream in the Czech Republic -- where five days of flooding killed at least eight people and forced some 20,000 evacuations -- rescue workers in rubber dinghies were supplying isolated families who lack drinking water, power or gas.\n\nIn the industrial centre of Usti nad Labem near the German border, where 11,000 people were told to evacuate, looters targeted empty homes and businesses, and a waiter at a pub-restaurant told how he came face to face with three robbers at night.\n\n\"I entered the corridor and got a blow. They broke my nose, my side is sore and there's something wrong with my ribs,\" Ladislav Kratochvil told the DNES daily.\n\nThe capital Prague held up well thanks to 17 kilometres of temporary aluminum barriers, and city trains were running again, but people in Usti bemoaned their poorer flood defences.\n\n\"It's a shame. If they were a meter higher, it would have been enough,\" a police officer told the DNES. \"It went fast, the water rose really quickly.\"\n\nIn Austria, where two people have died in the floods, the Danube town of Korneuburg just north of Vienna reported an all-time record river level of 8.06 meters.\n\nIn nearby Nussdorf a river cruise ship with some 120 tourists onboard was stranded in the middle of the river Thursday, an AFP photographer witnessed.\n\nDown the Danube in Hungary, preparations moved into high gear to prepare Budapest for the wall of water coming along one of Europe's longest waterways that empties into the Black Sea in a delta in Romania and Ukraine.\n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban has warned large-scale evacuations were likely because of \"a real threat to human life\" but has pledged that \"with good cooperation, we can protect everyone\".\n\nAn \"anti-catastrophe team\" with 10,000 volunteers and close to 12,000 police and troops was on stand-by, while some 300 people had been evacuated so far.
