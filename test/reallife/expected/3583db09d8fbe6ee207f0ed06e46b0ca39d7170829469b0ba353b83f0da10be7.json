	"text": "Heavy rain was pouring across much of Florida early Thursday as the first tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane season headed toward the state's western coast and a new tropical storm warning was issued for a swath of the US east coast.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect for a large section of Florida's west coast from Boca Grande to Indian Pass and for the east coast from Flagler Beach, Florida, all the way to Cape Charles Light in Virginia.\n\nTropical Storm Andrea's maximum sustained winds increased to near 60mph and the storm was expected to make landfall in Florida's Big Bend area Thursday afternoon before moving across southeastern Georgia and the Carolinas. It was not expected to strengthen into a hurricane.\n\n\"The rain covers a good portion of the Florida peninsula even though the center is a couple of hundred miles off shore,\" said Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist at the US National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\nStorm surge would be the biggest threat as the storm comes onshore, Blake said. The Hurricane Center expects a storm surge of up to 4ft \"near and to the south\" of where the center makes landfall.\n\nHe added that flash flooding was a concern, with up to 6in of rain expected. Isolated areas in Florida and southeastern Georgia could get 8in of rain.\n\nAlready, the National Weather Service in Tampa confirmed two tornados touched down early Thursday one in Myakka City and the other in Sun City Center. Meteorologist Rodney Wynn said there were reports of downed tree limbs and power lines and minor damage to the porch on at least one home. There were no reports of injuries.\n\nWynn said there have also been reports of minor flooding in the area, including along Tampa's Bayshore Drive.\n\nTornado warnings and watches could be issued throughout the day.\nThe storm was expected to hug the coastline, bringing rain as far as the southern New England area through the weekend.\n\nAs of about 8am EDT Thursday, the storm was centered about 160 miles west of Tampa and was moving north-northeast near 14 mph.\n\nIn Florida, Gulf Islands National Seashore closed its campgrounds and the road that runs through the popular beach-front park Wednesday. The national seashore abuts Pensacola Beach and the park road frequently floods during heavy rains. On Pensacola Beach, condominium associations asked people to remove furniture on high balconies because of the expected high winds and beach lifeguards warned tourists of possible high surf.\n\nIn Alabama, authorities said that 13 people had to be rescued from rough surf kicked up by the storm Wednesday at beaches in two coastal towns. Most of those rescued did not require medical treatment.",
