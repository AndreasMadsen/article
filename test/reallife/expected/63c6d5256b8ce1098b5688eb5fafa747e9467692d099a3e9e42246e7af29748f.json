	"text": "The European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile has captured new photos of a cosmic ribbon as it streaks through space in the Orion nebula more than 1,000 light-years away from Earth.\n\nThe 'fiery ribbon,' as scientists are calling it, is made up of dust clouds and part of a massive star-forming region that produces some of the youngest stars ever discovered. The composite image includes visible light and infrared light at wavelengths too long for the human eye to see (which are the dust clouds shown in red-orange).\n\nThe dust clouds captured by the telescope are just a few degrees above absolute zero in temperature. The image is just a small area of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, which the ESO describes as \"a rich melting pot of bright nebulae, hot young stars and cold dust clouds,\" and is located about 1,350 light-years from Earth.\n\n\"The large bright cloud in the upper right of the image is the well-known Orion Nebula, also called Messier 42,\" ESO officials wrote in a news release. \"It is readily visible to the naked eye as the slightly fuzzy middle 'star' in the sword of Orion. The Orion Nebula is the brightest part of a huge stellar nursery where new stars are being born, and is the closest site of massive star formation to Earth.\"",
