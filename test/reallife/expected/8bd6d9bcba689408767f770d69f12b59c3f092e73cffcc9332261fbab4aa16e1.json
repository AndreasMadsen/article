	"text": "It's time for a pair of tech heavyweights to report quarterly earnings after the markets close Thursday. Let's look at the technology stocks to watch.\n\nGoogle shares up slightly. With its stock price slowly marching toward the $1,000 mark, the tech titan reports second-quarter earnings after the bell.\n\nAnalysts expect Google to report an earnings per share of $10.78 with revenue of just over $14 billion.\n\nShares of Google have surged in the past 12 months, adding more than $300 in value since hitting a 52-week low of $580.76 on this day a year ago.\n\nMicrosoft to report earnings. Shares of the Redmond, Wash., company are barely up in pre-market trading as the company reports quarterly earnings after unveiling a massive restructuring.\n\nLast week, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced a major reorganization of the company he says will help them become more efficient.\n\nThe company has also made news related to its product line. Last week, the company slashed prices on its Surface RT tablets by $150. In May, the company revealed the Xbox One, its video game console that will succeed the Xbox 360. However, reception to the console has been mixed, primarily due to restrictions to software that have since been removed.",
