	"text": "On the heels of Google's invitation to members of the press for an Android launch event on July 24, leaked pictures of the new Nexus 7 tablet have made their way online.\n\nAlthough we don't know too much about the event, we do know Google's senior vice president of Android and Chrome will lead a discussion about the future of those platforms. Now, AndroidCentral has posted pictures of what seems to be the next-generation Nexus 7 device.\n\nThe tablet in the pictures is manufactured by Asus and includes a 7-inch LCD display as well as two cameras (a 1.2-megapixel camera in front and a 5-megapixel one in back). The original Nexus 7 only included a front-facing camera.\n\nThe report also indicates the new Nexus 7 will pack a Qualcomm APQ8064 motherboard with a Snapdragon S4 Pro processor. Other features include a microUSB for charging and dual speakers.\n\nThe device is expected to have both 16GB and 32GB storage options, and possibly as much as 4GB of RAM, although that seems unlikely. AndroidCentral wrote that it is programmed with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean.\n\nWhat do you want in the new Nexus 7? Share your ideas in the comments.",
