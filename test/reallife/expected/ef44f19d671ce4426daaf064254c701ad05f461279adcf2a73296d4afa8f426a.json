	"text": "HOOVER, Ala. â€” With his signature deadpan look, Nick Saban opened up his interview session at SEC Media Days Thursday with a joke.\n\n\"I had a great vacation,\" he said. \"Then I get the opportunity to come here and see 1,200 of my very closest fans.\"\n\nThe crowd laughed, then Saban got down to business. He said he'd be remiss if he didn't thank his staff and all those who have helped bring the Crimson Tide so much success in the last several years. Alabama has won back-to-back national titles and three in the past four years.\n\nThen Saban poked more fun at the media, which has become somewhat of a pastime for the coach, saying that they're 4-17 in picking the SEC champion.\n\n\"Now if I had that record, I would be in West Virginia pumping gas at my daddy's gas station,\" he said.\n\nThroughout media days, SEC coaches have been asked their opinions of hurry-up offenses. Saban has been vocal about his opinion, which is to side with the fact that they could pose a safety hazard for players.\n\nSaban was asked about a rules change regarding the up-tempo style.\n\n\"Should we allow football to be a continuous game?\" he asked. \"Is that the way it was designed to be played?\"\n\nHe said he does not have the answers to those questions, but noted that teams in the NFL average \"about 64\" plays per game, but college teams average more than that. Despite his groans, Saban is focused on preparing his players for that style of play.\n\nSaban, who is known in the media for his hatred of comparison questions, was asked the best one to date regarding himself and legendary Alabama coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant. He took a deep breath and complimented Bryant.\n\n\"Bear Bryant is the greatest coach ever,\" he said.",
