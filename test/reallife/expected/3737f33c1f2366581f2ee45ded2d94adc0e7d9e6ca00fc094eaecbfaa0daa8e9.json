Hairston was charged with possession of marijuana late Wednesday, Durham police confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to police, Hairston was stopped at an intersection for a license check at 10:20 p.m. Wednesday. He and two other passengers face misdemeanor drug charges. Hairston also was charged with driving without a license.\n\n\"Coach Williams and (director of athletics) Bubba Cunningham are aware of a situation that took place last evening with P.J. Hairston,\" UNC senior associate athletic director for communications Steve Kirschner said in a statement. \"We're currently looking into it to gather the facts. We will issue a statement when we have enough information to do so.\"\n\nHairston, a 6-5 rising junior, bypassed the NBA to stay at North Carolina for another season after averaging 14.6 points and 4.3 rebounds a game as a sophomore.\n\n\"I value the experiences I have had over the past two years in Chapel Hill and hope to continue to grow under Coach Roy's guidance,\" Hairston said in a statement when he announced his return. \"Coach always says when you focus on the team during the season, he will support us in the offseason â€” this is my way of supporting coach, my teammates and the Tar Heel community. Go Heels!\"\n\nOn Monday, Hairston was invited to compete for a spot on the 2013 USA Basketball World University Games team. The training camp begins June 24.",
