	"text": "Do-it-all video app VLC will return in a new iOS version on Friday, while RunKeeper has gotten a few new options to boost its utility, and cab-calling app Uber has gotten some new features.\n\nVLC will return to the App Store on Friday in the form of a full rewrite but still sporting the same play-anything functionality that has made the app popular. The fully open-source app has new ways to sync media, video filters and playback speed manipulation, support for subtitles, AirPlay compatibility, and more.\n\nVLC for iOS 2.0 also has native Dropbox integration, the ability to download files from a web server, iTunes file sharing, and the ability to stream from a network.\n\nVLC for iOS version 2.0 will be available as a free download in the App Store on Friday. It will require an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch running iOS 5.1 or later.\n\nRunKeeper gets real with expert trainer options\n\nPopular fitness tracking app RunKeeper is adding a new feature aimed at giving users even more options to make the app their own personal pocket trainer. The app is now adding a number of paid options from expert trainers in addition to the existing training plans. Those options, previously available only on the web, will now be accessible through the mobile app.\n\nExpert advice will include not only running as a topic, but also nutrition, hydration, stretching, and other fitness-related subjects. Plans range between $20 and $30, and users can buy them either on the web or through the RunKeeper iOS app.\n\nRunKeeper will offer 34 plans at launch, of which 13 will be free. The app is available as a free download in the iTunes App Store for users with iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads running iOS 5.0 or later.\n\nUber update brings fare splitting\n\nPrivate taxi service Uber recently updated its iOS app to add the ability to split fares easily between cab sharers. By tapping the arrow icon within the app, users can access the \"Fare Split\" option, which automatically divides the fare between the contacts a user selects.\n\nFor users without the app, the app will send them a text message encouraging them to download Uber.\n\nVersion 2.8.6 of the Uber app is available as a free download in the iTunes App Store. The 14.4MB download requires iOS 5.0 or up, and it is compatible with iPhone 3GS and up, third-generation iPod touch and up, and iPads.",
