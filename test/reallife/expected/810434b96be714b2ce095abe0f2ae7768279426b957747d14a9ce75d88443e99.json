	"text": "HTC Corp.’s new diminutive smartphone is another indicator that high-end smartphone makers are trying to woo a more price-conscious set.\n\nThe Taiwanese smartphone maker took the wraps off a smaller, less-expensive version of its flagship One smartphone on Thursday. The One Mini has a 4.3-inch 720p high definition touchscreen compared to the One’s 4.7-inch HD screen, but keeps the same aesthetic of aluminum body and dual speakers.\n\nMarket leader Samsung Electronics Co. has also recently unveiled a mini version of its Galaxy S 4 smartphone. And Apple Inc. – which started the “mini” trend with its iPad mini – is also working on a lower-cost iPhone to launch later this year, as The Wall Street Journal reported in January.\n\nIn developed economies, the market for premium smartphones is increasingly saturated. Meanwhile, lower-cost brands are catching up quickly in terms of technical functionality and design.\n\nAnalysts say high-end smartphone makers are trying to cope in part by launching lower-cost phones that try to ride off the marketing for their high-end siblings by keeping the name of the flagship. While HTC, for instance, has always offered some lower-cost smartphones, they previously went by a different name than the high-end devices.\n\n“The One Mini is targeting a different market segment, people who maybe like the HTC brand but aren’t willing to spend a lot of money on the One,” said Barclays analyst Dale Gai. “The ‘mini’ market is extremely marketing-driven, because customers who care a lot about the specs will get a high-end phone.”\n\nHowever, analysts say sales of the mini smartphones from HTC and Samsung are expected to be much smaller than those for their flagships, as they will be going up against a range of lower-cost mid-tier competitors.\n\nThe One Mini has many of the same features as the One, including an “UltraPixel” camera optimized for function in low-light conditions, as well as the BlinkFeed interface. However, it has a lower-power 1.4GHz dual-core processor compared to the One’s 1.7GHz quad-core one.\n\nPricing for the One Mini is not yet available, but will be announced regionally in coming weeks.",
