Science News: \"This is the oldest primate skeleton of this quality and completeness ever discovered and one of the most primitive primate fossils ever documented.\"\n\nThe research team was led by Xijun Ni from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. Dr Ni described the fossil this week in the science journal Nature.\n\nDr Ni recovered the fossil 11 years ago while doing fieldwork years ago in Hubei Province, near Jingzhou City, south of the Yangtze River, and about 270 kilometers southwest of Wuhan City, the province capital.\n\nIt was found by a farmer in a quarry that had once been a lake, and is known for producing ancient bird and fish fossils.\n\nAchilles was encased in a rock that the farmer split open, revealing the tiny creature. He soon after donated it to the IVPP.\n\nThe discovery was kept on the down-low for more than a decade, in part because the blend of anatomical features had never been seen before, and was difficult to interpret.\n\nIt had a very long tail, was active during the daytime and would have been an excellent leaper, feeding on insects that were almost as big as he was. Dr Ni said Achilles would have weighed between 20 and 30 grams.\n\nAchilles appears to have developed close to the base of the tarsiers evolutionary tree. Dr Ni said the discovery \"marks the first time that we have a reasonably complete picture of a primate close to the divergence between tarsiers and anthropoids\".\n\nHe said the recovery of Achilles \"represents a big step forward in our efforts to chart the course of the earliest phases of primate and human evolution\".",
