	"text": "An \"intelligent\" knife that can sniff out tumours to improve cancer surgery has been developed by scientists.\n\nThe Imperial College London team hope to overcome the dangerous and common problem of leaving bits of the tumour in a patient, which can then regrow.\n\nEarly results, in the journal Science Translational Medicine, showed the \"iKnife\" could accurately identify cancerous tissue on the spot.\n\nIt is now being tested in clinical trials to see if it saves lives.\n\nTo avoid leaving cancerous tissue behind, surgeons also remove surrounding tissue.\n\nThey can even send samples off for testing while the patient is still in theatre, but this takes time.\n\nYet one in five patients who have a breast lump removed still need a second operation to clear their tumour. For lung cancer the figure is about one in 10.\n\nNew tool\n\nThe team at Imperial College London modified a surgical knife that uses heat to cut through tissue.\n\nIt is already used in hospitals around the world, but the surgeons can now analyse the smoke given off when the hot blade burns through tissue.\n\nThe smoke is sucked into a hi-tech \"nose\" called a mass spectrometer. It detects the subtle differences between the smoke of cancerous and healthy tissue.\n\nThis information is available to the surgeon within seconds.\n\nTests on 91 patients showed that the knife could accurately tell what type of tissue it was cutting and if it was cancerous.\n\nDr Zoltan Takats, who invented the system at Imperial, said: \"These results provide compelling evidence that the iKnife can be applied in a wide range of cancer surgery procedures.\n\n\"It provides a result almost instantly, allowing surgeons to carry out procedures with a level of accuracy that hasn't been possible before.\n\n\"We believe it has the potential to reduce tumour recurrence rates and enable more patients to survive.\"\n\nTrials are now taking place at three hospitals in London - St Mary's, Hammersmith and Charing Cross.\n\nProf Jeremy Nicholson, head of the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College London, said: \"This is part of what we call precision medicine, we're trying to change the world by very aggressively translating scientific discovery in to the NHS.\"\n\nSurgeon Dr Emma King, of Cancer Research UK, said: \"The iKnife is an exciting development to guide cancer surgeons during operations.\n\n\"If its usefulness is supported in further clinical trials, it could potentially reduce the time spent in theatre for many patients.\"",
