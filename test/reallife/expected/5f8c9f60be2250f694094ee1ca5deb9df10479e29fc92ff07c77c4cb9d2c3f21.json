	"text": "Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood is planning protests in Cairo and elsewhere on July 19 to demand the return to power of ousted leader Muhammad Morsi.\n\nOn the eve of the planned protests, Egypt's interim leader Adli Mansour claimed that some people were trying to create turmoil in Egypt.\n\n\"We are going through a critical stage in the history of Egypt, and some want for it to be a road to the unknown,\" he said. \"We want for it to be a road to something better. Some want it to be the start of chaos, while we want it to be the start of stability. They want for it to be an entrance into violence and bloodshed and we want it to be the foundation for a good life and the assurance of human rights.\"\n\nIn his first public address since being sworn in on July 4, Mansour insisted that his government is committed to restoring security and stability.\n\n\"I reaffirm to you all my commitment and the government's commitment to restoring security and stability in our country,\" he said. \"We will not be scared or alarmed, and we will not go easy on those who kill the innocent. We will fight a battle for security until the end. We will protect the revolution. We will build the nation and we will move forward without hesitation.\"\n\nMorsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, was deposed by the military two weeks ago following massive protests against him.\n\nMansour has issued a timetable for parliamentary elections by early next year followed by a presidential poll, possibly by May.\n\nBrotherhood official Gehad el-Haddad told the Reuters news agency that the organization would not retreat from its demand for the reinstatement of Morsi.\n\nHowever, he also said that the Brotherhood had proposed a framework via an EU envoy for talks to resolve Egypt's crisis.",
