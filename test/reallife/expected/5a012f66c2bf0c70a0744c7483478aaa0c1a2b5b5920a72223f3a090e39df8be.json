	"text": "Summary: When Microsoft releases Windows 8.1 later this year, it will include a slew of usability changes designed to address user complaints. I've put together my own list of small changes that would make Windows 8.1 more usable. Maybe they'll make it into Windows 8.2 next year.\n\nOne of the most common objections I hear to the charms menu is that itâ€™s too hard to find.\n\nYou summon the five charms with a swipe of the mouse to the upper or lower right corner, or with the keyboard shortcut Windows key + C.\n\nThe trouble with that is that the hidden charms menu is hard to reach, requiring a gesture all the way to the upper right corner, followed by a swipe down to the Search charm.\n\nBut what if you could pin the charms menu so it were always present? That menu is a mere 86 pixels in width, which still allows plenty of room for your apps and even the desktop, as this mockup shows. And with the charms visible, it would be much easier to search or share, or do anything else that would otherwise require multiple gestures.",
