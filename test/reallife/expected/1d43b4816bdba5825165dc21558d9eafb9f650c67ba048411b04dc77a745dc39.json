	"text": "Topping tech headlines on Wednesday, Pew Research Center announced that most American adults now own smartphones - for the first time since the organization began tracking smartphone adoption in the U.S.\n\nOf the 2,250 adults polled by Pew, about 56 percent now own a smartphone. About one third own a feature phone, while the remaining 9 percent don't have a cell phone at all.\n\nThe proliferation of smartphones has also lead to a rise in thefts. On that front, New York and San Francisco officials will meet with reps for Apple, Motorola, Samsung, and Microsoft next week to come up with ways to deter criminals from swiping their most popular gadgets.\n\nMeanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices is finally open to making computer chips that run Google's Android and Chrome operating systems, according to news out of the Computex show in Taiwan. A top AMD executive told PCWorld on Wednesday that the company \"is expanding OS options\" for its future chips based on both the x86 and ARM architectures.\n\nAlso making headlines yesterday, a company called Whistle is focused on leveraging technology to better the lives of pets. The company unveiled its flagship device of the same name, which straps on to collars and provides 24-hour monitoring of your dog's activity and rest patterns, providing early detection of subtle changes that could indicate more serious health problems.",
