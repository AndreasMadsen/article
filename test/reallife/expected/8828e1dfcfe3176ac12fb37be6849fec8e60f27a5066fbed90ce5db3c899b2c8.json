	"text": "The Los Angeles Kings have re-signed their captain Dustin Brown to an eight-year contract paying him an average of just over $5.75 million.\n\nThe Kings, just 13 months removed from winning the Stanley Cup, now have their top players Mike Richards, Jeff Carter, Drew Doughty, Slava Voynov, Jonathan Quick and Brown tied up in deals that are five seasons or longer. Anze Kopitar has three seasons left on his deal.\n\nThe eight years is the maximum contract length allowed under the new Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nBrown, 28, is scheduled to make $3.1 million in 2013-14. He would have been an unrestricted free agent next summer; if the Kings hadn't re-signed him. He had 18 goals and 11 assists last season.\n\nHe has been the team's captain since Oct. 8, 2008.",
