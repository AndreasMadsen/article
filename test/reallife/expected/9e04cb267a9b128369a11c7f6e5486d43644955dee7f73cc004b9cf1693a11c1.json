	"text": "Residents of Afghan villages where a US soldier went on a rampage last year have reacted with anger that he has escaped the death penalty.\n\nAt a US military hearing on Wednesday Staff Sgt Robert Bales, 39, admitted killing 16 civilians in March 2012.\n\nA jury will decide in August whether he is sentenced to life with or without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe villagers in Kandahar province argue that he has been treated far too leniently and should be hanged.\n\nMost of the victims were women or children, and many of them were shot in the head. Some of the bodies were piled up and burnt.\n\n'Full of blood'\n\nFriends and family members of those killed say they were stunned to learn that he has escaped capital punishment.\n\n\"It is our firm demand that Afghanistan, the US and the international community condemn this American to death. He martyred our family members... and went back with his body full of blood of his victims to his camp,\" bereaved villager Mullah Baran told the BBC.\n\nAnother villager, Haji Baqi, whose brother was killed by Bales, said: \"We want him to be hanged. The international community should not ignore our grief.\"\n\nVillager Samiullah said the life sentence meant that justice had not been done. His mother, uncle and cousin were killed.\n\n\"The criminal is not being punished,\" he said. \"We want him to be dealt with as his deeds deserve.\"\n\nAt Wednesday's hearing, Bales read from a statement describing each killing in the same terms:\n\n\"I left the VSP [Village Stability Platform] and went to the nearby village of Alkozai. While inside a compound in Alkozai, I observed a female I now know to be Na'ikmarga. I formed the intent to kill Na'ikmarga, and I did kill Na'ikmarga by shooting her with a firearm. This act was without legal justification, sir.\"\n\nWhen asked by military judge Col Jeffery Nance why he had carried out the murders, Bales responded: \"There's not a good reason in this world for why I did the horrible things I did.\"\n\nDefence lawyers have said Bales is contrite about the killings, and described him as \"crazed\" and \"broken\" on the night of the attack.\n\nAt the time, he was serving his fourth tour of duty and had been drinking alcohol and snorting Valium.\n\nIn addition to the 16 murdered, six Afghans were injured.\n\nWhile prosecutors originally said they would seek the death penalty, no US service member has been executed in more than 50 years.",
