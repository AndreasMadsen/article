	"text": "The Kings' reign as Stanley Cup champions didn't end with a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals. But you certainly could see the finish line from where they teetered Thursday at Staples Center.\n\nThe Blackhawks, faster and more opportunistic with the puck, pushed the Kings to the brink of elimination by rallying twice and then surging into the lead in the opening moments of the third period. The Kings failed to respond and trail the best-of-7 series three games to one.\n\nThe Blackhawks limited the Kings to two shots on goal in the final period.\n\nGame 5 is Saturday at United Center.\n\nThe winner of the Western Conference finals plays the victor in the Eastern Conference finals\n\nin the Stanley Cup Final later this month. The Boston Bruins took a 3-0 series lead over the Pittsburgh Penguins with a double-overtime victory Wednesday.\n\nMarian Hossa gave the Blackhawks a 3-2 lead 1:10 into the third period, Chicago's first edge in six periods at Staples Center in the series.\n\nThe Blackhawks rallied from deficits of 1-0 and 2-1 before Hossa handed them the lead and, ultimately, the Kings' first home loss in nine games.\n\nThe Kings have lost seven of eight on the road during the playoffs.\n\n\"We've got to be ready,\" Kings defenseman Drew Doughty said. \"We're going to watch some video and prepare that way, but I think the most important thing is everybody just has to look at themselves in the mirror and expect the best from each and every one of us.\n\n\"Without that, there's no way we can beat this team. They're a good team, but if our top players lead the way - that's the way we're going to win these next three games. Now that we're down 3-1 and people aren't expecting us to win, we can go in there as if we have no pressure on us.\"\n\nThe Kings must clean up their neutral-zone play and find a way to score more than their playoff average of two goals per game. The Blackhawks turned a misplay at center ice during an ill-timed line change into Hossa's go-ahead goal and then muzzled the Kings the rest of the way.\n\n\"They're a very aggressive team,\" Kings defenseman Rob Scuderi said of the Blackhawks. \"They play right on top of us and there's almost constant pressure. You have to realize it's there. If you have time, make a play. If not, put (the puck) in a safe spot or put it behind them.\n\n\"You can always live to fight another day, but if you turn the puck over it could result in a scoring opportunity. I think (turnovers) kill your momentum. Usually, when you make a turnover you've got at least one guy out of position and they come back on odd-man rushes.\n\n\"I truly believe that when we play the type of game that's all north all the time, we're playing at our best. Right now, we're not getting it 100 percent of the time.\"\n\nSlava Voynov scored in the first period and Dustin Penner scored in the second for the Kings, who were seeking to duplicate their strong start to Tuesday's Game 3, a 3-1 victory. Bryan Bickell scored in the first and Patrick Kane scored in the second for the Blackhawks.\n\nKings goaltender Jonathan Quick misplayed Bickell's perimeter shot, a rare gaffe for the reigning Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the MVP of the 2012 playoffs. Blackhawks goalie Corey Crawford then failed to cover up a loose puck on Penner's goal.\n\nKane rallied the Blackhawks a second time and made it 2-2 in the closing moments of the second period by punching a loose puck behind Quick.\n\nBickell's deflection of Niklas Hjalmarsson's perimeter shot appeared to be going over the goal line, but Kane made sure.\n\nIt was only the third goal of the playoffs for Kane after he scored 23 during the regular season.\n\nThe deadlock lasted for only 70 seconds of the third period, with Hossa sending a laser past Quick on a one-timed shot from the faceoff circle. Michal Handzus set up Hossa with a pass from the center of the ice to the wing, and Hossa's shot was unstoppable.\n\n\"We know they are playing so well at home, so we are happy to finally break their streak,\" Hossa said. \"Coming home up 3-1 we are very pleased. We're not finished yet and we have to win one more, which won't be easy.\n\n\"We can enjoy this victory for now, but we'll be sure we're ready at home.\"",
