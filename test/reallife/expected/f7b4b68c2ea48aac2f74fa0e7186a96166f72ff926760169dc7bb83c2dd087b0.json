	"text": "Raffi Torres is under scrutiny from the NHL again.\n\nThe San Jose Sharks forward will meet with the league in New York on Thursday over his hit on Los Angeles Kings center Jarret Stoll during Game 1.\n\nThe incident occurred Tuesday with less than a minute left in the second period. He was given a two-minute penalty for charging, but the league said the hearing will be based on the illegal hit to the head infraction.\n\nThe fact that an in-person hearing was offered means that the league could impose a suspension of greater than five games.\n\nStoll didn't return after the hit.\n\n\"You know what? I didn't play Jarret in the third period, and he wasn't resting, so that pretty well tells you, doesn't it?\" coach Darryl Sutter told reporters after the game about Stoll's status.\n\nThe Kings said Wednesday that Stoll is day-to-day with an undisclosed injury.\n\nTorres, a repeat offender then playing for the Phoenix Coyotes, was given a 25-game suspension during last season's playoffs for a late, leaping hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. Hossa left the ice in a stretcher and suffered a concussion.\n\nTorres appealed the length of the suspension and Commissioner Gary Bettman handed down a 21-game penalty instead. Torres was forced to sit out the first eight games of the regular season.\n\nHe had cleaned up his game this season and the Sharks dealt for him at the trade deadline to improve their physical play. He had two goals and six points in 11 games after arriving in San Jose, plus scored an overtime goal in Game 2 of the first round against the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nTorres said after the game that he didn't think the hit was going to be a penalty.\n\n\"They called it charging, but I don't feel launched myself. I took a step and a half and glided into him,\" he told reporters, according to NHL.com. \"Obviously, he was leaning over. I still feel like I got shoulder to his shoulder, and then it looked – because he was leaning over – that I came up a little high ... I hope he's all right.\"",
