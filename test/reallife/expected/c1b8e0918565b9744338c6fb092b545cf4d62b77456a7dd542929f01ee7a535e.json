	"text": "Healthy life expectancy, or the expected years of life in good health, for persons aged 65 is generally less in the southern United States than elsewhere in the nation, says a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAccording to the report, the healthy life expectancy, or HLE, of 65-year olds is the lowest in Mississippi - where it is 10.8 years, and the highest is in Hawaii - where it is 16.2 years. HLE as a percentage of life expectancy for persons at age 65 years for the total U.S. population ranged from a low of 61.5% in Mississippi to a high of 78.2% in Vermont.\n\nIn all the 50 states and the District of Columbia, HLE at age 65 years, is higher for females than males. Whites have a greater HLE than blacks in all the states, barring Nevada and New Mexico.\n\nThe findings are based on 2007-2009 data from the National Vital Statistics Systems, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.",
