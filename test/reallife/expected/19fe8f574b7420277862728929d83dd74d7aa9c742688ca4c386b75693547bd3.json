	"text": "GAMES CONSOLE SHIFTER Microsoft has revealed the terms and conditions that will bind its Xbox One users to the company through their consoles and the internet.\n\nThe firm's upcoming console has been a source of controversy, mostly about how often it has to be turned on and call home and what you can do with games that you don't like or have finished.\n\nThe bad news is that the bad news is true. Microsoft will insist that Xbox One consoles must connect to the internet every day.\n\nIt has claimed that this will be easy, and added that all Xbox One users will have broadband connections. Microsoft said that this will help the cloud console keep a handle on games, game savers and gamers.\n\n\"While a persistent connection is not required, Xbox One is designed to verify if system, application or game updates are needed and to see if you have acquired new games, or resold, traded in, or given your game to a friend. Games that are designed to take advantage of the cloud may require a connection,\" it said.\n\n\"With Xbox One you can game offline for up to 24 hours on your primary console, or one hour if you are logged on to a separate console accessing your library. Offline gaming is not possible after these prescribed times until you re-establish a connection, but you can still watch live TV and enjoy Blu-ray and DVD movies.\"\n\nThe firm has also clarified what can happen with pre-owned games. Here the suggestion has been that a charge of over £30 will be involved if you wanted to shift a title, but Microsoft said that this is not the case. However, games can be traded only once, at \"participating retailers\".\n\n\"We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers. Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games,\" it said.\n\n\"Xbox One is designed so game publishers can enable you to give your disc-based games to your friends. There are no fees charged as part of these transfers. There are two requirements: you can only give them to people who have been on your friends list for at least 30 days and each game can only be given once.\" µ",
