	"title": "Man With 'Micropenis' Discovers He's Actually A Woman At Age 66",
	"text": "For most of his life, a man thought his penis was just unusually small. Then, after decades coexisting with the unfortunate fact, at age 66 the man discovered he was actually a woman.\n\nAfter visiting a hospital in Hong Kong with a swollen abdomen, the unnamed patient was examined by doctors.\n\nThe diagnosis? A cyst on the ovaries of the patient, who grew up thinking he was a male.\n\nThe startling revelation was published this week in the Hong Kong Medical Journal, where doctors wrote out the explanation as to how someone could go so long thinking they were the opposite gender.\n\nDoctors from Kwong Wah, where the patient was treated, and from Queen Elizabeth Hospital said the patient suffered from two different conditions which ultimately gave him the internal organs of a woman but the physical appearance of a man.\n\nThe patient has both the chromosomal abnormality known as Turner Syndrome and the genetic disorder congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).\n\n\"The patient, by definition, is a woman who cannot get pregnant. But she also has CAH, which gave her the appearance of a man,” Ellis Hon Kam-lun, a pediatrics professor from a Chinese University, told the South China Morning Post.\n\n\"It's an interesting and very rare case of having the two combinations. It probably won't be seen again in the near future.\"\n\nCases like this, where both disorders occur simultaneously, are so rare in fact there have only been six instances recorded in medical history.\n\nThe 4'5\" tall, bearded man has a “micropenis” and no testicles. However, according to the journal, the patient has decided to continue “perceiving himself as having a male gender with the possible need of testosterone replacement.”",
