	"text": "Looks like Sprint's got itself a brand new Optimus. Sprint this morning announced that it plans to begin selling the LG Optimus F3 through its website on June 14, with a launch in all Sprint channels (like its stores) slated to happen this summer. Pricing for the Optimus F3 will be set at $29.99 with a two-year contract and $50 mail-in rebate.\n\nSo just what will buyers be getting in exchange for their hard-earned cash? The front of the Optimus F3 features a 4-inch IPS display, a camera and a physical home button that's flanked on both sides by capacitive back and menu keys. Around back is a 5-megapixel camera, and buried inside the Optimus F3's frame is a 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 4G LTE support and a 2,460mAh battery that's powering the whole package. Sprint will sell the Optimus F3 in silver and purple versions.\n\nOn the software side of things, Sprint is touting the Optimus F3 as being the first phone to come preloaded with TalkBack, a text-to-speech feature that will provide voice guidance to help blind and visually-impaired users to set up and use their device. The Optimus F3 also comes with Sprint ID, which can be used to access the new Accessible Education ID pack with apps focused on math, science and micro lectures. Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean will be preloaded onto the Optimus F3 at launch.\n\nWith its $29.99 price tag, the Optimus F3 will be one of Sprint's most affordable 4G LTE-capable devices when it launches later this month. The F3 could also appeal to Sprint customers looking for a smaller handset thanks to its 4-inch touchscreen, which is a display size that's becoming increasingly rare in the smartphone world. Sprint's full announcement of the Optimus F3 is available at the link below.",
