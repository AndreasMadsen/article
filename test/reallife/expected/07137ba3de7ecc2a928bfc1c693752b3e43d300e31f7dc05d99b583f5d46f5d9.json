	"text": "Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones and coach Jason Garrett confirmed Thursday that Tony Romo will be a full participant when training camp begins Sunday in Oxnard, Calif.\n\n“He feels good. He looks good,” Jones said. “He’s uniquely out running mountains right now out west. He’s getting himself physically in shape. He’s never thrown a lot in the off-season at all. It’s always been a time for him to rest his arm. I’m confident. I know his weight is right. I feel that he’ll be in shape and ready to go.”\n\nGarrett added: “We believe Tony will be ready to play. It seems like he’s in good shape.”\n\nRomo was held out of organized team activities and mini camp as he recovered from an April procedure to have a cyst removed from his back. Romo threw a few passes off to the side during the final day of mini-camp and didn’t seem to be experiencing any discomfort or change in throwing motion.\n\n“I feel good. Just being smart,” Romo said after a mini-camp practice on June 11. “We could go this week but it looks like the training staff guys just want to be cautious, take it back a couple days after and then start up full speed next week.”",
