	"text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A rule change for Saturday night's NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race raised eyebrows Wednesday, but NASCAR said it was a simple oversight not meant to benefit any specific driver.\n\nIn 2012, drivers were eligible to win the All-Star Race fan vote – which goes to the top vote-getter who isn't already qualified for the main event – if they finished on the lead lap of the preliminary Sprint Showdown and had a car in raceable condition (i.e., not wrecked).\n\n12 QUESTIONS: With Martin Truex Jr.\n\nA press release earlier this year said the fan vote rules would be the same for Saturday's race, as have all press releases about the fan vote since 2004. But NASCAR clarified the rule Wednesday and said the fan vote winner would not have to finish on the lead lap to receive the free transfer spot.\n\nThat's notable because Danica Patrick is widely presumed to be the runaway fan vote winner since she's the biggest star not already in the race.\n\nSTENHOUSE JR: Comfortable as Danica's other half\n\nSo was NASCAR making a Danica Rule in order to ensure her path into the All-Star Race would be easier?\n\nAccording to the entry blanks – which are not available to the public – that's not the case. An entry blank examined by USA TODAY Sports makes no mention of a fan vote winner having to finish on the lead lap this season.\n\nThat's also the case for entry blanks from 2007-11, though the 2012 entry blank did have that requirement. Apparently, though, the 2012 lead lap rule was a mistake and it was corrected this year.\n\nHowever, that wasn't communicated prior to the press release with the rules being issued. NASCAR spokesman Kerry Tharp said that loophole has been corrected for the future and future releases will always reflect the language on the entry blanks.\n\nTharp said this year's change was in no way a reflection of any driver who might get the fan vote.\n\nBut curiously, the press releases for the All-Star fan vote have had that \"lead-lap finish\" language every year since it was started in 2004. Even in the years when the entry blank had no such requirement, media and fans were still told it was.\n\nThe information was widely disseminated on TV, print and online outlets and no one thought to question otherwise. NASCAR itself stated those were the rules.\n\nAs it turns out, there was no official lead-lap requirement. The sudden clarification, though, looks questionable because of Patrick's obvious selection.\n\nIt certainly doesn't do any favors for Patrick, who some fans perceive already gets treated differently by NASCAR and the media.\n\nOf course, all this might be a moot point. The Showdown is so short (two 20-lap segments) that it's highly unlikely Patrick would be lapped, unless she crashed. But if she did crash, her car wouldn't be in raceable condition anyway.",
