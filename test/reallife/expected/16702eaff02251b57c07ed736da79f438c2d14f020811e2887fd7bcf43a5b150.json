	"text": "President Obama honored the Super Bowl XLVII Champion Ravens Monday at the White House.\n\nThe team arrived in DC late in the morning on-board 9 busses for the noon event with the President that was heard live on WBAL.\n\nThe Ravens presented President Obama with a jersey during the big event.\n\nYou can continue to listen for live coverage on AM 1090 WBAL.\n\nWBAL's team coverage throughout the day will include reports from Keith Mills, Brett Hollander, Scott Wykoff and the Voice of the Ravens Gerry Sandusky.\n\nOn the South Lawn, Obama praised the team not only for the goal line stand that sealed its second Super Bowl trophy but its charitable work in Baltimore.\n\nQuarterback Joe Flacco was singled out for winning the Super Bowl's most valuable player - and a miracle touchdown pass at a playoff game in Denver - which helped him win a huge $100 million-plus contract in the off-season. \"Good timing with that contract up,\" Obama said. The graying Obama praised safety Ed Reed for the Super Bowl's only interception, though he noted Reed's sprouting some gray hairs of his own. \"You're looking like an old man,\" Obama said.\n\nAnd the president cited legendary linebacker Ray Lewis for returning from injury to lead the defense in the playoffs - but only after kidding Lewis that he thought his arm injury came from the motivational dance he performed at every home game. They shared a bear hug after the event.\n\nRavens executive Ozzie Newsome gave Obama, the 44th president, the traditional team jersey emblazoned \"MR PRESIDENT\" and the number 44. Obama wished the team luck but warned them they'll face a tough game against his beloved Bears when they visit Chicago next November.\n\nHead Coach John Harbaugh kept his remarks brief but he had a welcome message for the assembled Ravens fans: \"I want you to know that we have plans to come back (to the White House) next year.\"\n\nObama also praised the players for their charitable work.\n\n\"You'll see players spending their Tuesdays - normally their only day off during the season - visiting hospitals and schools and senior centers, and day after day, you'll see a team that loves Baltimore as much as Baltimore loves the Ravens,\" Obama said.",
