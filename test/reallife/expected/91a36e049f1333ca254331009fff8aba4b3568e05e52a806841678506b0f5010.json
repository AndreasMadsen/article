	"text": "ILLINOIS — A 20-minute yoga session improved mental function better than slow to rigorous aerobic workouts, US health experts said.\n\nUniversity of Illinois Exercise Psychology Lab director Edward MacAuley said the research involved 30 young female undergraduate participants.\n\nNeha Goethe, who spearheaded the research at the university said that “Yoga is an ancient Indian technique as well as a way of life which not only includes body postures and movements but also meditation and controlled breathing.”\n\nGoethe is a Kinesiology, health and sport studies professor at the Wayne State University in Detroit.\n\nGoethe said that yoga involves an active mindfulness element but its potential advantages have not been substantially explored.\n\nThe study’s yoga intervention involved a one 20-minute progression method of standing, seated and supine-yoga positions which included a so-called relaxation and “isometric contraction” of different muscles as well as regulated breathing techniques.\n\nThe student-participants also finished an exercise routine where they jogged or walked on a treadmill for about 20 minutes.\n\nGoethe and fellow researchers said that they were surprised to find out participants showed an improvement in accuracy and reaction times on mental tasks after the yoga session, while the body exercise routines indicated no huge improvement on the memory and inhibitory control results.",
