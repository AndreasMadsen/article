	"text": "Rolando McClain is retiring from the NFL. The Baltimore Ravens announced that the 23-year-old linebacker, who signed with the team on April 12, gave his decision to general manager Ozzie Newsome on Wednesday.\n\n— McClain joins gallery of biggest draft busts\n\nMcClain, in just more than a month with the Ravens, couldn't shake the off-field issues that plagued him as the 2010 eighth overall pick of the Oakland Raiders. Just 10 days into his one-year contract with the Ravens, McClain was arrested for the second time in four months and for the fourth time since 2011. The most recent arrest was for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest in his hometown of Decatur, Ala.\n\nIn January, then still with the Raiders, McClain was booked into jail for providing a false name when a police officer pulled over his car for a window-tint violation. The incident also occurred in Decatur, and the Raiders released McClain on April 5.\n\nIn January 2011, McClain was investigated for his involvement in a drive-by shooting in Decatur. In December 2011, he was charged with four misdemeanors. He was later found guilty on all counts and was sentenced to fines and jail time.\n\nWith Ray Lewis retiring and Dannell Ellerbe leaving as a free agent, the Ravens were hoping McClain—who shares an alma mater (the University of Alabama) with both Newsome and former Baltimore All-Pro fullback Le'Ron McClain (his cousin)—could help them rebuild their inside linebacker corps.\n\nRookie Arthur Brown will fill one of the vacant starting jobs, and the Ravens hope veteran Jameel McClain (no relation to Rolando) will be healthy enough to hold down the other.\n\nIn three NFL seasons with the Raiders, Rolando McClain posted 274 career tackles in 41 games. McClain was a first-round pick (eighth player chosen overall) in 2010.",
