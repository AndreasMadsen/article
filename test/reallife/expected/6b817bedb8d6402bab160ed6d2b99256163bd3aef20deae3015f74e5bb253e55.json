	"text": "Can a wetsuit protect a diver from sharks? In Western Australia, where shark attacks (although still rare) have risen sharply, officials and scientists alike are testing whether the answer may lie in fashion.\n\nSo, when it comes to avoiding sharks, is it better to stand out or to fade into the background?\n\nA \"conspicuous\" wetsuit with big white and deep-blue stripes on the arms and legs makes a diver obvious to sharks. A \"cryptic\" version has been likened to the Harry Potter invisibility cloak. It comes in shades of white, gray and aqua.\n\nWill either work?\n\n\"I kind of have to chuckle,\" said shark expert Chris Lowe, a professor at Cal State Long Beach.\n\n\"First of all, we really don't know what motivates sharks to occasionally bite people,\" said Lowe, who heads the university's Sharklab. \"That makes it kind of tough to come up with a 'fits all' solution -- be it an electric, chemical repellent, visual discourager or purported invisible cloak.\"\n\nSecond, he said, \"one of the favorite prey items of tiger sharks in Australia is sea snakes.\" These poisonous snakes have a banding pattern. \"Imagine swimming or paddling around looking like a giant sea snake. ... I think I would just prefer to look like a human in the water. We already have a very low chance of being bitten.\"\n\nThe wetsuits were developed by Shark Attack Mitigation Systems (SAMS) in Perth, Australia, in conjunction with scientists from the University of Western Australia and Ray Smith, who was the original Quiksilver brand designer.\n\nAccording to SAMS, wearing the suits should \"significantly\" reduce the risk of being attacked.\n\nSome work by allowing the wearer \"to effectively blend with background colors in the water,\" making it hard for the shark to \"detect or focus.\" The blue suit can't be seen by the shark, the makers maintain, because the fish are color blind. Others work by making the wearer \"highly visible\" and \"totally unlike any normal prey.\" In other words, the suit is supposed to scream, I am not a seal.\n\nThe Western Australia government was among investors in the project, according to SAMS, providing funds for initial research and development.\n\nPerhaps the project seemed a better solution to officials than their original idea: Kill the sharks.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Times reported last fall, Western Australia reacted to the surge in fatalities from shark attacks with a plan to kill any shark that swam close to the beach, even great whites, which it usually protected as an endangered species.\n\nConservationists protested, and the clash brought up the often-pondered question: Is the risk of shark attacks on humans really that significant?\n\nThe headlines are horrifying. \"Shark Bites 15-Year-Old French Girl in Half;\" \"Shark Attacks Pacifica Kayaker With 'Pink Gums and His Teeth Bared';\" \"Great White Shark Gets Head Into Shark Diving Cage.\"\n\nBut shark experts have long maintained that the risk of attack is relatively low.\n\n\"It's far more dangerous driving to the beach\" than swimming in the ocean, Lowe said.\n\nStill, run-ins between humans and sharks have become more common -- and Australia is notorious.\n\nLowe is among authors of the study \"Responding to the Risk of White Shark Attack,\" which shows that from 1876 to 2008 there were 346 unprovoked white shark attacks around the world.",
