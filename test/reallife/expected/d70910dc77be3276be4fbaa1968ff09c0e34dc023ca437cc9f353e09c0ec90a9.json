	"text": "WHO SAYS all comedians have a sense of humor?\n\nJerry Seinfeld, a huge Mets fan - his dog is named Jose, after former Mets star Jose Reyes - chastised New York fans for booing at opposing players during the All-Star Game at Citi Field.\n\n\"This is one of the lowest moments of my lifetime of Mets fandom, when the Citi Field crowd was booing [players] that they see as rivals to their Mets team,\" Seinfeld told WFAN. \"And I'm standing there, I was in shock. I was embarrassed. I thought it was horrible manners.\n\n\"These are the best players, in the game you love, that have come here to put on a show for you, and we're booing them like 5-year-olds. As if there's some sort of real animosity. The American League is not the Taliban. What are we booing Miguel Cabrera [for]? . . . So I was very embarrassed by that.\"\n\nLighten up, Jerry. Fans boo.\n\nAnd, if you don't like it well . . . don't ever come to an Eagles game.\n\nBad break\n\nGolf can be an expensive sport and we're not talking about buying clubs or greens fees.\n\nDuring the first round of the British Open yesterday, Thomas Bjorn shattered a video camera lens while hitting out of the rough on the first hole.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Mike Tirico, the lens cost $80,000.\n\nBjorn made a double-bogey six on the hole and finished the first round at 2-over 73.\n\nWatts up?\n\nWho says white men can't jump?\n\nIn a video that's going viral, Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watts makes a vertical leap to the top of a stack of boxes that was 59.5 inches from the floor.\n\nThat breaks the mark he reached last year in a video shown during an interview with Bob Costas before the Texans-Packers game.\n\nNow we know how he swats down all those passes.\n\nTo put his feat in perspective, consider that he could - without a running start - jump onto the roof of a small passenger car.",
