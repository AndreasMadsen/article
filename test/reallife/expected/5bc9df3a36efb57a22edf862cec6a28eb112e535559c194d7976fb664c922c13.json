	"text": "BlackBerry is quick to acknowledge that it has a ways to go on the road to re-establishing itself as a, if not the, leading mobile brand. At its 2013 BlackBerry Live conference, which kicked off May 14 in Orlando, Fla., the company celebrated how far it has already come and made a long list of announcements, offering a sense of the road ahead. It introduced the Q5, its first mid-tier smartphone to run BlackBerry 10. It announced plans to extend BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) to Android and iOS devices this summer. It introduced BBM Channels, a social networking platform that puts BBM users in contact with companies and brands. It also announced the immediate rollout of BlackBerry 10.1, offered a small peek at its work in the connected-car space and introduced a college scholarship program to help women rise to positions of power in the tech world. BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins, making F1 metaphors, after a cameo appearance from F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, said during the morning's events, \"We're on the starting grid. I wouldn't yet claim that we have pole position ... but we are going to do everything we can to see the checkered flag first. That is our aspiration.\" Read on for highlights from the conference's kickoff.",
