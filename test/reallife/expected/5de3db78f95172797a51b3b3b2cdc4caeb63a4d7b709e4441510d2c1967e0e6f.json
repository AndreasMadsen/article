But until now, the idea of being able to silence the effects of a whole chromosome had appeared beyond the realms of possibility, even in the lab.\n\nNow scientists at the University of Massachusetts Medical School have shown that, in theory, this might be possible but would take decades of research.\n\nA team led by Dr Jeanne Lawrence inserted a gene called XIST into the stem cells of a person with Down's syndrome grown in the lab.\n\n'Exciting research'\n\nThe gene plays a role in normal cell development by switching off one of the two X chromosomes present in female embryos, ensuring daughters avoid a double dose of X chromosome genes.\n\nThe experiments showed that the gene was able to silence the extra copy of chromosome 21, helping correct unusual patterns of growth in the cells.\n\nDr Lawrence told BBC News: \"The research means that we have a new way - right away - to study the cellular basis for Down's syndrome, that could help identify drugs for Down's syndrome.\n\n\"At the same time we have made it conceivable - not necessarily possible or effective, that still needs to be proven - but conceivable that you could use just a single gene to correct the over-expression of the whole chromosome. So it makes genetic therapy for Down's syndrome more conceivable where it really wasn't before.\"\n\nCommenting on the study, Carol Boys, chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association, said it was exciting new research from a very well-respected team.\n\n\"The findings could have serious implications for future work that may be of real benefit to people with Down's syndrome,\" she said.\n\n\"We are a very long way from understanding how these findings might translate into clinical applications but it could be that they will be of great assistance in the search for conventional treatments for some of the health conditions that affect people with Down's syndrome.\"\n\nDr Lucy Raymond, from the department of medical genetics at the University of Cambridge, said the group had demonstrated an important proof of concept.\n\n\"This is an exciting breakthrough, but this process is still at a very early [cellular] stage and we are nowhere near seeing this procedure being used in the treatment of Down's syndrome in people.\"",
