	"text": "Injury forced Andy Murray to retire midway through his second-round match at the Italian Open in Rome on Wednesdayâ€”his 26th birthday. He might have to sit out the French Open, too.\n\nMurray walked off the court after winning the second set against Spanish opponent Marcel Granollers.\n\n\"I have an issue with my lower back,\" Murray said. \"It's been an issue for a while.\n\n\"I would be very surprised if I was playing in Paris. I need to make a plan as to what I do. I'll chat with the guys tonight and make a plan for the next few days then make a decision on Paris after the next five days.\n\n\"I want to make sure it goes away,\" Murray added. \"It's been a problem since the end of 2011 but it got bad during last year's clay season.\"\n\nRome is a key warm-up for the French Open at Roland Garros, the year's second Grand Slam, which starts on May 26.\n\nAfter Granollers won the first set 6-3, Murray took a long injury break early in the second set, getting his left thigh and lower back massaged. Murray won the second 7-6 (5) on a tie break before calling it a day.\n\nElsewhere at the Foro Italico, rising Polish player Jerzy Janowicz upset eighth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-4, 7-6 (5) and celebrated by ripping his shirt apart and tossing the pieces to the crowd.\n\nThe 22-year-old Janowicz improved his record against top-10 opponents to 3-5, having closed last year by reaching the Paris Masters final as a qualifier, beating Murray and Janko Tipsarevic along the way.\n\nTwo-time defending women's champion Maria Sharapova eased past Spanish qualifier Garbine\nMuguruza 6-2, 6-2, and will now face 16th-seeded Sloane Stephens, of the U.S.\n\nStephens, who reached the Australian Open semifinals in January with a win over Serena Williams, beat Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.\n\n\"She [Stephens] has been climbing up against the rankings,\" Sharapova said. \"I haven't played against her in a while. I'm excited about that match up. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nLast year's runner-up, Li Na, beat fellow Chinese player Zheng Jie 6-3, 6-1.",
