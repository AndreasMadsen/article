	"text": "Samsung has left all other Android-based smartphones in the dust, according to a recent report from advertising and Web analytics firm Chitika.\n\nSamsung accounts for more than 47 percent of all U.S. and Canadian Web traffic. HTC comes in at a distant second place, with 9.7 percent.\n\nIt is clear that the South Korean electronics giant held what Chitika called \"a significant edge\" over other Android manufacturers by the end of the second quarter. But a by-device breakdown might be surprising.\n\nIn fact, while the Galaxy S III does account for a majority of traffic (32 percent), it's the older, non-flagship devices that make up large pieces of the pie. A quarter of all traffic comes from \"other\" models like the Galaxy Ace, while the Galaxy S II carries 14 percent Â— the third largest, ahead of the Galaxy Tablet (13 percent), Galaxy Note (9 percent), and Galaxy S 4 (7 percent).\n\nSamsung may be the top phone maker, but Amazon's 8.8 percent share figure is particularly noteworthy, Chitika noted. The online retail giant has released only the Android-based Kindle and Kindle Fire line of tablets, not yet venturing into the smartphone realm, like most other companies on the list.\n\n\"However, Amazon's high share isn't completely surprising due to Kindle Fire generating the second-highest amount of tablet Web traffic in North America,\" Chitika said.\n\nHTC, Motorola, Amazon, and LG round out the top five; meanwhile, Google, Huawei, Sony, Barnes & Noble, Asus, and Toshiba, among others, garnered 2.5 percent or less.\n\nChitika's report is based on online ad impressions seen between June 17 and 23.\n\nFor more, see PCMag's reviews of the Samsung Galaxy S III and Galaxy S 4, as well as the slideshow above.",
